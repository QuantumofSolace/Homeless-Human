# How to Help.

While charity and donations are helpful, you wouldn't be reading this if that was enough for you. We support people in efforts to directly help to get the homeless of their community into better living situations. While there are many useful guidelines and resources, there is no one-size-fits-all soloution to homelessness and poverty. Each and every person needs the genuine help and love of another human, if we're to fix any of this.

It can be difficult to directly approach a person who seems in need of help. Even if the person has reached out, it's not easy to handle the situation in the best way. Often, the best way can be completely counterintuitive. For that reason, we've put together a comprehensive training system for methodically handling the homeless with care. This seven part method is based on the best statistics, psychology, economics, and other solid data, and completely avoid any subjective, opinionated, or judgmental views.

### Stage One: Build Rapport
Establishing a safe, trusting environment can be a challenge right off the bat. Approach the person with a confident, purposeful walk, with eye contact. Smile, and ask them directly if you can help them. If the person is clearly homeless, you may want to start with "Do you have somewhere to stay?" or a similar question. Simply starting with "How are you?" can make a difference all on its own.

#### Good Contact Technique
Using good contact techniques is essential to building a working relationship with who we'll refer to as a client. Open-ended questions, emotional validations, and displays of empathy are all vital.

### Stage Two: Exploration
Before we can help the client, we first need to discover what exactly it is that we're helping them with. By using conversational techniques, we can begin to understand what caused the situation to get to the point it's at. This is the stage where we can find out if an immediate soloution is needed, or if a more long-term life change is needed. Is this the end of a rope, or is this a sudden crisis? We can make no assumptions about the client, and need to let them tell us their own story.

### Stage Three: Goal Identification
The third stage is to determine what the client wants to get out of the process. We try to empower the client to build up an image of a better future for themselves, without dictating what "better" means. They want an improvement, but what an improvement might look like is up to them. Sometimes, when depressed or feeling heavy anxiety, it can be surpisingly difficult for a person to imagine more than a few minutes ahead. This is probably the most challenging part of the process. We aren't trying to make the person feel dependent or helpless, but rather to help them identify their own strengths and play to those.
