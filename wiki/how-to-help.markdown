# How to Help.

While charity and donations are helpful, you wouldn't be reading this if that was enough for you. We support people in efforts to directly help to get the homeless of their community into better living situations. While there are many useful guidelines and resources, there is no one-size-fits-all soloution to homelessness and poverty. Each and every person needs the genuine help and love of another human, if we're to fix any of this.

It can be difficult to directly approach a person who seems in need of help. Even if the person has reached out, it's not easy to handle the situation in the best way. Often, the best way can be completely counterintuitive. For that reason, we've put together a comprehensive training system for methodically handling the homeless with care. This seven part method is based on the best statistics, psychology, economics, and other solid data, and completely avoid any subjective, opinionated, or judgmental views. If you need it (Seriously. You want to help. This is good.), there's a lesson on [Cultural Awarness and Sensitivity](#cultural-awareness-and-sensitivity). 

## Direct Aid Model

### [Stage One: Build Rapport](./training-direct-stage-one)
Establishing a safe, trusting environment can be a challenge right off the bat. Approach the person with a confident, purposeful walk, with eye contact. Smile, and ask them directly if you can help them. If the person is clearly homeless, you may want to start with "Do you have somewhere to stay?" or a similar question. Simply starting with "How are you?" can make a difference all on its own.

### [Stage Two: Exploration](training-direct-stage-two)
Before we can help the client, we first need to discover what exactly it is that we're helping them with. By using conversational techniques, we can begin to understand what caused the situation to get to the point it's at. This is the stage where we can find out if an immediate soloution is needed, or if a more long-term life change is needed. Is this the end of a rope, or is this a sudden crisis? We can make no assumptions about the client, and need to let them tell us their own story.

### [Stage Three: Goal Identification](training-direct-stage-three)
The third stage is to determine what the client wants to get out of the process. We try to empower the client to build up an image of a better future for themselves, without dictating what "better" means. They want an improvement, but what an improvement might look like is up to them. Sometimes, when depressed or feeling heavy anxiety, it can be surpisingly difficult for a person to imagine more than a few minutes ahead. This is probably the most challenging part of the process. We aren't trying to make the person feel dependent or helpless, but rather to help them identify their own strengths and play to those.

### [Stage Four: Problem Solving](training-direct-stage-four)
Now that we've figured out what a better future means to the client, we can start to work with them to develop a plan to get them into that life. We still want this to be mostly client-driven. You'll be armed with resources to give for almost every case you'll run into. Sometimes, this will involve identifying their current coping skills, which may not be helping them. We can start to look at alternative ways to cope, while paving a path to make that much easier for them to follow through with. Aside from creating a plan, this stage can also help the person to feel a sense of control over their future, and get them much more engaged in the process.

### Cultural Awareness and Sensitivity ###
We're part of a highly diverse population. As a helper (a person doing outreach), you will be meeting people of all ages, races, ethnicities, cultures, genders, sexualities, and socio-economic backgrounds. Using strong [Empathetic Response](training-direct-stage-one-empathetic-response) and solid [Active Listening](training-direct-stage-one#reflection--paraphrasing) skills, you can support _anyone_.

To dispell some common thoughts that make this more difficult:


Myth  |  Fact
----- | -----
Everyone is equal, so we should ignore race, ethnicity, and culture. | Everyone does deserve to be treated equally and with respect. However, we are in no way all the same! Our different cultures and life experiences define our differences, and those differences make us human.
People who belong to a particular racial, ethnic or cultural group are similar. | Everyone is unique. Within any given culture, there are differences just as within your own.
Discrimination isn't a real problem anymore, and people who say it is are playing the "race card". | No matter how _you_ may feel, it's important to validate the client's feelings in order to help them. Using the phrase "playing the race card" in particular completely invalidates them on a number of levels. It's a responsibility to empathise fully and place yourself into their shoes - not your own.
Targets for slurs should just get over it. It's just words, and people are jerks. | We have no right or reason to judge how the client feels about anything. We use the best empathetic skills we have to show (not tell) our client that we do actually understand their feelings. This doesn't require sympathy, and you don't need to agree with the person's feelings. But you do need to understand and validate them.

Bearing these few things in mind, you can go out being culturally conscious, and use it to shape how you treat others. Whether that's natural for you, or anything but natural, you can adapt to your biases and get them out of the way. But in order to do that, you have to be _completely honest_ with yourself. Any bias, including ones you may _feel_ are justified, can be controlled. You have to identify your bias before you can work with it.
