#### Empathy ####
Let's note first, that there is an important distinction between empathy and sympathy. Empathizing means immersing yourself in the experience of sstanding in a person's shoes in a genuine attempt to understand how they see and experience life. Empathy allows you perspective, and the ability to refect accurately for them. As opposed to sympathy, which expresses pitty. Nobody likes to be pittied, and sympathy is almost _never_ helpful.

It can seem counterintuitive at first, but asking exploratory questions can clarify a lot for both you and the client. This means leaning into and embracing pain. In doing that, you show them that you're at ease with hearing _anything_ they need to talk about in that moment. Exploring the painful things might be uncomfortable, but that's just because discomfort is another name for pain. And that was a terrible attempt at humor.

Helping somebody carry their weight can be the thing that makes them see that they matter, and accept the help that we can offer. You can't take the weight by saying you're sorry, or giving advise. Giving empathy can genuinely lighten the load.
Sharing our pain with others—shouldering the burden so that the other person doesn’t have to bear the whole weight—is what could take someone through an extremely difficult moment. If someone is carrying a heavy load on their back, you aren’t helping with the weight of that load by sympathizing, by saying “sorry,” or by suggesting they carry it in a different way. Someone practicing empathy, on the other hand, would simply help carry the load! Sounds scary, right?

Empathy has to be used strategically with all clients, every single time, the whole time. Focus in on what seems to be dominating their emotional landscape, and go from there. You don't have a time limit here, and they may not be ready to jump into solving their problems just yet. It has to be their choice, and it has to be them fixing the problems. You can only help.

#### Tone ####
Part of empathy is putting out a tone of warmth. After the conversation, the client might not remember the details - but they _will_ remember the feelings. Warmth can't come through an AI for a reason. Warmth comes from a human, and you have to actually _be_ and _feel_ warm in order to give it out with authenticity. Let yourself care, and open up. You're not going to naturally have feelings for everyone the same as for everyone else, and that's normal. You have biases, and you need to know that and know what they are. Concetrate on being deliberately empathetic and nonjudgmental in those situations - remember that your judgments and opinions on the person aren't necessary if they aren't supportive.

You can't approach this like a job - and that's why you're a volunteer. Helping a fellow human for their sake is the only motive that can function in this. Be sensitive, and supportive. Adapt to their mannerisms and language, and if they don't seem to be up to it - try another day.
