Empathy & Tone
Empathy

If practicing empathy was karate, you’re going to graduate this training with a black belt. Before you get there, it’s important to note the distinction between empathy and sympathy. Empathy means you put yourself in someone else’s shoes and attempt to see the world as they see it. Being empathetic allows Crisis Counselors to understand a texter’s life experience enough to reflect back what it might feel like. Gaining perspective is important in order to meet texters where they are. On the other hand, sympathy is a feeling of pity and sorrow for someone else’s misfortune, and often results in advice-giving rather than being supportive. Texters reach out because they are looking for a connection—not pity.
Part of empathy means asking questions and exploring the texter’s issues. We encourage you to ask texters to clarify what they mean—not to shy away from specifics. Leaning into the pain shows them that you’re comfortable with hearing the most difficult parts of what they are going through. If exploring painful emotions feels uncomfortable at first, you’re not alone!
DataBite When comparing texters who strongly disagree and strongly agree with the statement, “In the conversation, I feel my Crisis Counselor cared about me even when I mentioned things that were uncomfortable for me to say,” the percentage of texters who mentioned an experience they had not shared with anyone else increased from 51% to 78%.

Sharing our pain with others—shouldering the burden so that the other person doesn’t have to bear the whole weight—is what could take someone through an extremely difficult moment. If someone is carrying a heavy load on their back, you aren’t helping with the weight of that load by sympathizing, by saying “sorry,” or by suggesting they carry it in a different way. Someone practicing empathy, on the other hand, would simply help carry the load! Sounds scary, right?


The Empathetic Response Formula

As you learned at the beginning of this lesson, empathy is an overall tone and an “umbrella” strategy that we use to talk to all texters, all the time. Underneath that umbrella, there is the Empathetic Response Formula:
Empathetic Response Formula

Empathetic Response Formula Examples

Texter: I don’t even know how I’m supposed to have a life. My parents won’t let me have friends or go out and they just want me to study all the time.
Crisis Counselor: It sounds like you’re feeling furious because of your parents’ inflexible rules.
Texter: I just started dating this new guy and now my best friend won’t even talk to me, even though I’ve texted her like a million times.
Crisis Counselor: I’m hearing that you’re feeling abandoned because you haven’t heard back from your friend.
You’re already a master of tentafiers and feeling words. The source of the feeling is the precipitating event; a description of what evoked the emotion. For instance, a texter might have experienced anxiety for most of their life, but their fight with Mom was the reason we were contacted now.

You may identify many feelings and sources, but focus on what’s dominant — you don’t have to weave them all into one response or you risk further confusing and overwhelming the texter. You can always add more feeling words in future messages.
You’ve got this! Give it a try!
Texter: I haven’t cut in months now and feel better. I’m bummed though because I met this girl who asked me to go swimming next week. The only bad thing is the scars
Crisis Counselor:

Texter: My anxiety has been so bad lately and I don’t know why or what to do. My mom’s new bf is now moving in and I hate him
Crisis Counselor:


Tone

A critical part of being empathetic to a texter is warmth. After a texter talks to you, they may not remember exactly what you said, but they will always remember how you made them feel. Here are some things to keep in mind to help you sound warm to texters:
Warmth can’t be expressed through template responses. You don’t DO warmth, you have to actually feel it so that you can BE warm. Always aim to express warmth authentically. Let your natural, empathetic reactions inform the way you talk to texters.
Accept the fact that you won’t naturally feel as much warmth for some texters as you do for others. That’s okay! Recognize your bias, and concentrate on being empathetic and nonjudgmental in these cases.
Warmly ask for the texter’s name after establishing initial rapport (about 5-8 messages in). If they aren’t comfortable sharing, that’s okay too!
Be sensitive and pick up on the texter’s reactions to your style of warm language. If they aren’t digging it, try another approach.
Here is a great example of a Crisis Counselor using warm language to build rapport and show support of a texter.
Texter: People always think I’m a girl but that’s not how I feel inside. It hurts to be called the wrong pronouns. I don’t want to be around people or tell them that I’m trans ever again.
Crisis Counselor: You know Sam, having your body not match how you feel can be paralyzing. You deserve to choose how people refer to you. It makes sense that this is frustrating for you.
The Crisis Counselor showed warmth, an empathetic tone, and a mix of Good Contact Techniques. Can you spot the strength ID and validation?
DataBite In the U.S., 71% of texters identify as White, 15% as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish Origin, 11% as Black or African American, 6% Asian, and 4% American Indian. They are all strong for taking their mental-health into their own hands and texting in for help. Boom, strength ID!
