# Direct Aid Model
## Stage One - Build Rapport

#### Good Contact Techniques
By employing skills such as active listening, empathy, unconditional positive regard, developing trust, and being nonjudgemental, you'll learn how to gather the right information. You'll understand their situation, and how they think and feel - this isn't a comfortable process to go through.

Your first impression is going to be important. The way you approach and greet the person matters a lot, and is something that needs thought and deliberate action. For example "Hi, I'm Casey. Do you have somewhere to live right now?", or "Excuse me, my name is Casey, can I help you out?". It needs to be made clear immediately that your intent is to offer aid, competently. Your goal is to create a connection with the person. There are many strategies that can help with this; an odd example is making sure to ask their name around five or six sentences in, if they haven't already given it. Restating their name at that point if they've already given it is also effective.



Reflection & Paraphrasing

Reflection and paraphrasing refer to re-wording statements to demonstrate your understanding of the issue. These techniques show that you are listening to the texter and doing your best to put yourself in their shoes. You can also use it when you want to double-check that you’re understanding the texter correctly. When utilizing this technique, don’t repeat (parrot) what the texter says word for word (that comes across as robotic and doesn’t show understanding). Instead, process what they say and reflect the essence of what they are going through. This shows the texter that you really hear them.
Parroting

Parroting

Texter: “I’m so alone and the fight with my boyfriend is just really pissing me off and now I can’t even talk to him about what I’m going through.”
Crisis Counselor: “So you’re saying you’re so alone and the fight with your boyfriend is just really pissing you off and now you can’t even talk to him about what you’re going through?”
Wish: Try not to repeat (parrot) what the texter says word for word. Instead, take a shot at processing what they are telling you to show that you are truly listening.
Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing

Texter: “I’m so alone and the fight with my boyfriend is just really pissing me off and now I can’t even talk to him about what I’m going through.”
Crisis Counselor: “So you already felt isolated, and today’s fight just added fuel to the fire?”
Plus: Great use of a strong feeling word that captures the essence of what the texter is going through. This helps the texter feel understood and heard.
DataBite_Transparent Our most effective Crisis Counselors are 3x more likely to use clarifying questions (e.g., “am I understanding you correctly?”). These questions tell the texter that you understand them while avoiding the introduction of any opinion or advice. These Crisis Counselors are also 30% more likely to check for suicidal thoughts early, in response to high risk texters and 2.5x as likely to thank the texter for contacting Crisis Text Line.



Validation

To validate is to recognize, normalize, and accept a texter’s thoughts, feelings, and experiences. People often feel alone in their situation and think no one else cares; validation can build rapport and encourage a texter to open up further. Validation lets texters know that their feelings are normal and natural. You can use it when texters (a) have just described a difficult emotion or (b) try to minimize their feelings.
Some examples of validating messages are: “It’s normal to be frustrated when you don’t feel heard by your parents,” or “From what you’re saying, it’s understandable you don’t feel comfortable opening up to your parents.”
Texter: “It’s stupid for me to feel this way”
Crisis Counselor: “It’s normal to be frustrated with your parents when they don’t listen to you.”
Crisis Counselor: “From what you’ve been saying about the fight, it’s understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed and upset.”
That being said, be conscious of your timing when validating. For example: a texter reveals a sexual assault, and somehow feels at fault. Saying “It’s understandable to feel that way” might suggest that you agree with this conclusion. A better validating message would be to say “Sometimes people feel that way after an assault, but please know it was absolutely not your fault. No one deserves to be assaulted.”
Use Validations To:

Recognize and normalize the texter’s feelings.
Accept the texter’s emotions and crisis without judgement.
Thoughtfully show the texter that you hear and support them.
Give the texter space and permission to feel the way that they feel.
Avoid Validations That:

Imply that the texter is at fault.
Imply that the texter deserves to be going through their crisis.
Imply that their feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness are justified.
Imply that they should continue with mentally or physically harmful behavior.
Give it a try! Respond to the following texts using the opening statements provided.

Texter: “My gf is 5 months pregnant and I wasn’t ready for this. I feel guilty because part of me wishes she had gotten an abortion…”
Crisis Counselor: “It’s understandable to feel…”
Texter: “I was like OMG. how could my teacher read my poem out loud for everyone? I was kinda flattered he thought it was good, but mortified that everyone now knows my parents are divorcing.”
Crisis Counselor: “It’s normal to be…”
DataBite_Transparent Our data shows that the 5 most effective validations contain the words “reasonable,” “normal,” “makes sense,” “understandable,” and, “I see.”



Tentafiers

Tentafiers preface the labeling of a feeling to make it tentative. For example, “It seems as if you’re feeling upset,” or “I wonder if you’re feeling frustrated?” Using tentafiers allows you to get clarity on how the texter is feeling while still helping them feel in control. They help you avoid making assumptions. You can also use them to encourage the texter to share more about a particular feeling without asking a question. For instance, “It sounds like you are feeling worried about how your parents will react.”
Less Effective Example

Texter: “My bff attempted suicide 3 months ago and things have been really touchy ever since. I don’t know what to say to her and am afraid I’ll make things worse, so I haven’t really visited.”
Crisis Counselor: “You’re worried because she is too fragile after what happened.”
Wish: Telling the texter how they feel robs them of power in the conversation, and can make you seem like an authority figure that isn’t really listening.
Effective Example

Texter: “My bff attempted suicide 3 months ago and things have been really touchy ever since. I don’t know what to say to her and am afraid I’ll make things worse, so I haven’t really visited.”
Crisis Counselor: “I get the feeling that you’re worried that she’s too fragile to talk after what happened.”
Plus: The tentafier “I get the feeling that” allows CCs to get clarity about what the texter is feeling, while still helping the texter feel in control.
DataBite_Transparent Our data show that “You seem…,” “You think…,” “So you…”, and “It sounds like…” are the most effective tentafiers.



Open and Closed-Ended Questions

Open-ended questions can’t be answered with a simple yes or no. They allow texters to expand on their thoughts and feelings. And they allow you to explore the situation without resorting to interviewing. They should be used to dig a little deeper. As we guide the conversation and gather information, the texters tell their stories.
Closed-ended questions only require a yes or no. They’re not effective because they inhibit the texter from expanding on what they are feeling and thinking. They keep Crisis Counselors from gathering the information they need to best explore the crisis. Additionally, our data tells us that longer, meaty messages are associated with the most effective conversations. This is why closed-ended questions aren’t our faves.
DataBite_Transparent Longer messages are associated with the most effective conversations. Messages from our most effective Crisis Counselors are 34% longer on average. The average length for our most effective Crisis Counselors is 99 characters. All messages are limited to 160 characters**

It’s also best to avoid “why” questions because they can seem judgmental and accusatory over text; texters aren’t able to hear the intended tone. Have a look at the three different responses to the same text below, and take a second to reflect on the pluses and wishes of each one!*
Close-Ended Question

Texter: “My stepsister is the bane of my existence. I just can’t take it anymore.”
Crisis Counselor: “Did she do something?”
Wish: This closed-ended question could result in a single-word answer (yes or no) and doesn’t leave room for the texter to expand about their situation. It might also make the texter feel like they are being interviewed or interrogated.
Why Question

Texter: “My stepsister is the bane of my existence. I just can’t take it anymore.”
Crisis Counselor: “Why does your stepsister make you so upset?”
Wish: Why questions can sound accusatory to the texter, and often come off as more judgmental over text than they might in person.
Open-Ended Question

Texter: “My stepsister is the bane of my existence. I just can’t take it anymore.”
Crisis Counselor: “It sounds like your sister is really upsetting you. Can you tell me more about how she’s been horrible to you?”
Plus: Asking for more info allows the texter to expand upon their feelings, and the empathetic statement gives more meat to the message.
DataBite_Transparent How should you ask a question? That’s right! “How” questions are associated with the most effective conversations. “How” is followed in quality by “When,” then “What”. Asking questions using the word “Why” results in the lowest quality conversations!



Strength IDs

Strength Identifications (IDs) show the texter that they have inherent positive qualities, and that they have the strength to fight through their struggles. Giving Strength IDs is EMPOWERING!
DataBite_Transparent Our data shows that brave, smart, and proud are the 3 words that show up in our most successful convos. They’re all Strength IDs, which are one of our most powerful Good Contact Techniques.

Brave Smart Proud

Strength IDs point out the positives in a texter’s actions. People in crisis often focus on negatives, so it’s great to remind them of the positive things they’re doing! For instance, “It’s brave to reach out for support.” Strength IDs like this can guide texters toward being more receptive to help, while reflecting their inherent strengths back to them. This can also alleviate feelings of helplessness and hopelessness.
Additionally, Strength IDs empower the texter to work toward collaborative problem-solving and action-planning. That being said, it’s not effective to praise a texter with a Strength ID that you can’t tie to a visible action. For instance, you wouldn’t say, “You’re not stupid, you’re smart!” Texters who think they are stupid will not believe you. You could instead say, “It seems like reaching out for help was a smart and insightful thing to do tonight.”
Less Effective Example

Texter: “I’m terrified right now. My uncle was diagnosed with cancer and it’s not looking good. I heard they don’t have enough money for the hospital bills and I wish I could help but I’m in school. I suck.”
Crisis Counselor: “You don’t suck. You’re awesome. I can tell you are a really good person.”
Wish: While you’re telling the texter something positive about themselves, you’re also making a vague statement that can make your praise seem empty via text.
Effective Example

Texter: “I’m terrified right now. My uncle was diagnosed with cancer and it’s not looking good. I heard they don’t have enough money for the hospital bills and I wish I could help but I’m in school. I suck.”
Crisis Counselor: “I’m honestly impressed with your strength. You care greatly about your uncle and are carrying the weight of his pain. You seem like a thoughtful person.”
Plus: This Strength ID relate directly to the texter’s problem, it points out good qualities that are backed up by the texter’s own experiences and feelings.


Our very own Crisis Counselors shared their favorite Strength IDs with us so that we could put this table together, just for you!

Strength ID	Visible Action
It takes real courage…	to text in when you’re feeling XYZ.
It takes real strength…	To make your wellbeing a priority.
I can tell that you have great insight….	because you’re able to identify that this is a problem and you’re willing to work on it.
Its inspiring…	how much work you’re putting into getting help for yourself.
It shows true compassion…	to reach out, out of concern for your friend.
Wow, you have true perseverance…	for dealing with XYZ for so long.
I’m impressed…	with how well you know yourself and what you need at this tough time.
I can tell how committed you are…	to XYZ; this seems important to you.
I appreciate your bravery….	I know it’s not easy to share these things.
You’re a rockstar…	because against all odds, you keep on trying.


Silence

Oh, silence. It can be so uncomfortable, yet so powerful! A pause or a break in communicating may not feel like a Good Contact Technique—but it actually is! Text is made for this; It’s normal. The use of silence (a brief pause) is an underutilized technique that allows the texter and the Crisis Counselor to step back and to process. It allows space for the texter to elaborate if needed. Used consistently in a balanced manner, a silent pause demonstrates that you are paying attention and have respect for the person with whom you are communicating. We are not suggesting that you pause for too long. We just want to remind you that rapid-fire messaging doesn’t always leave enough room for texters to explore their feelings and empower themselves. Text by nature is asynchronous. If you feel the texter might elaborate, waiting for 30 seconds or one minute to giving him or her a chance to respond can sometimes be more compassionate than asking for more information.


Feeling Words & Vocabulary

Strong feeling words help our texters feel heard and understood. Finding the appropriate vocabulary for paraphrasing a texter’s crisis helps us (a) capture the uniqueness of the crisis (b) validate the texter’s feelings, and (c) better understand what the texter is going through.
The trouble is, most strong feeling words don’t seem natural to us. That’s okay! Part of your training here at Crisis Text Line will help you expand your feeling vocabulary. The more feeling words we have in our back pocket, the more specific we can be in understanding a texter’s feelings and thoughts.
To give you an idea of the impact feeling words and vocabulary can have, take a look at the two messages below, taking note of the pluses and wishes. It’s amazing what a difference a single word makes!
Less Effective Example

Texter: “I got fired from my job at the mall today. It was total crap – I didn’t do what they said I did but no one would believe me. I feel like I could punch somebody.”
Crisis Counselor: “It seems like you’re mad about being treated unfairly and not trusted.”
Wish: Telling the texter that they are “mad” doesn’t quite validate the strong emotions that the texter is feeling. Using a feeling word that is too weak can also minimize the texter’s feelings.
Effective Example

Texter: “I got fired from my job at the mall today. It was total crap – I didn’t do what they said I did but no one would believe me. I feel like I could punch somebody.”
Crisis Counselor: “It seems like you’re furious about being treated unfairly and not trusted.”
Plus: Saying that the texter is “furious” instead of just “mad” lets the texter know that you truly heard them, and helps you build rapport as you continue the conversation.


Rather than asking you to memorize a list, we want you to brainstorm some strong feeling words of your own. Take a look at the five categories below, and try to come up with three strong feeling words per category. We gave you a few examples to get you started.
Happy	Sad	Angry	Scared	Confused
Cheerful	Devastated	Furious	Nervous	Anxious
•	•	•	•	•
•	•	•	•	•
•	•	•	•	•
Now, take a look at this Cheat Sheet to find feeling words. Don’t worry, you won’t be expected to have memorized all of these words! The starred words in the Cheat Sheet are more advanced: use your judgment in deciding which words to use, based on the texter’s use of language. Cheat sheets like this will be available for you on the platform as you take conversations. You will notice, however, that over time certain words will feel more comfortable to you. As you read through the lists below, circle 5-10 words that you could see yourself using in conversation, and try to hold those in mind as you complete training.



Technique	Effect/Benefit	When to Use It	Example
Reflection and Paraphrasing	Shows that you are listening to the texter and doing your best to put yourself in their shoes.	When you want to doube-check that you’re understanding the texter correctly, without having to ask.	“So you already felt isolated, and today’s incident just added fuel to the fire?”
Validation	Lets the texter know that their feelings are normal and natural, and that there’s nothing wrong with them for feeling that way.	When the texter has just described a difficult emotion, or tries to minimize their own feelings. (For example, “It’s stupid for me to feel that way.”)	“From what you’ve been saying about the fight, it’s understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed and upset.”
Tentafier	Allows you to avoid making assumptions about what the texter is feeling.	To get the texter to share more about a particular feeling without asking a question.	“It sounds like you are feeling worred about how your parents will react.”
Empathetic Response	Shows (rather than tells!) the texter that you’re there for them.	When you want to show the texter that you care about what they’re going through (instead of using a sympathetic response like “I’m sorry.”)	“You’re saying you’re feeling abandoned because you haven’t heard back from your friend. It can be devastating to feel that way.”
Strength ID	Shows the texter that they have inherent positive qulaities, and have the strength to fight through their struggles.	To guide the texter toward being more open to help. To reflect and demonstrate the texter’s inherent strengths back to them. To empower the texter toward collaborative problem-solving and action planning.	“It was brave of you to reach out for help today.”
Open-Ended Question	Allows the texter to expand upon what they are feeling and thinking. Allows you to explore the situation without interviewing the texter.	To learn more and dig deeper into the texter’s thoughts and feelings. To give added momentum to the Exploration stage.	“Can you tell me more about the frustrating thoughts you’ve been having?”


Minimizers and Maximizers:

While using strong feeling words is important, it’s also important to avoid minimizers (such as a little angry, kind of mad) and maximizers (such as really angry, very mad.) These words tend to detract in two ways:
Minimizers detract from the intensity of a response. Even though we use these often in everyday speech, they have the effect of minimizing what texters are going through, and stand in the way of them feeling validated and heard.
Maximizers encourage the imprecise naming of feelings—they detract from the strength of feeling words and do little to help you identify and understand the experience being described.
Less Effective Example

Texter: “I think I’ve been depressed for a long time. I’m fat and I hate being this way, but I can’t get skinny. No one is ever going to like me”
Crisis Counselor: “I’m hearing that your weight is kind of bothering you.”
Wish: This CC response is a less effective example because the use of “kind of” minimizes the strong feeling of depression that the texter has expressed. It also detracts from the power of the CC’s validation, making the texter feel less heard and less supported in their moment of pain.
Effective Example

Texter: “I think I’ve been depressed for a long time. I’m fat and I hate being this way, but I can’t get skinny. No one is ever going to like me”
Crisis Counselor: “I’m hearing that your feelings about your weight are painful and upsetting.”
Plus: This CC response is an effective example because it successfully pairs a tentifier with reflection, paraphrasing, and a strong feeling word. It makes the texter feel heard and shows them that you are truly sharing in the burden of their pain.
Now, you give it a try! Try responding to the following messages using a strong feeling word, avoiding minimizers and maximizers in your response:

Texter: “Honestly I feel like the main problem is my parents. They never listen to me.”
Crisis Counselor:

Texter: “I thought being a mom would be the best thing that ever happened to me, but now I’m alone all day with my baby and I feel stuck.”
Crisis Counselor:

Texter: “I haven’t cut in months and now I feel better. I’m bummed though because I met this girl who asked me to go swimming next week. I’m worried about her seeing my scars.”
Crisis Counselor:

Texter: “My anxiety has been so bad lately and I don’t know why or what to do. My mom’s new bf is now moving in and I hate him!”
Crisis Counselor:



Some Technical Stuff

Grammar & Spelling: Proofreading is important. We strive to maintain a professional (not robotic!) tone, and typos or grammatical errors risk hurting that tone. Always strive for clear, grammatically correct messages. In the event a Supervisor needs to be involved or if you transfer a conversation, other Crisis Counselors should be able to read through and understand the conversation easily.
Exclamation Points: An exclamation point can seem sarcastic or ambiguous in tone over text, and can damage the professional tone you have established. We ask that you avoid using them.
Textspeak* (“how r u feeling?”): We don’t want to use textspeak (r, u, lol, thx) because it’s too colloquial for a Crisis Counselor. Professionalism is important during conversations with texters because they need to trust that we are reliable and competent.
Informal Language: While you don’t want to use text-speak or speak unprofessionally, Our data shows that conversations are more effective when you use more informal language. Here are a few examples:
“yeah” rather than “yes”
“hi” rather than “hello”
“don’t” rather than “do not”
“won’t “ rather than “will not”
“it’s” rather than “it is”
Sometimes we make spelling or grammar errors. Proofreading is important. If you make an error, don’t panic! The texter probably won’t notice a small error. If they do notice, the error will remind the texter that you’re human! In the event that you make an error that leads to some confusion, it’s totally okay to apologize and clarify what you meant.
