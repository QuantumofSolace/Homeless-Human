# Direct Aid Model #
## Stage One - Build Rapport ##

### Good Contact Techniques ###
By employing skills such as active listening, empathy, unconditional positive regard, developing trust, and being nonjudgemental, you'll learn how to gather the right information. You'll understand their situation, and how they think and feel - this isn't a comfortable process to go through.

Your first impression is going to be important. The way you approach and greet the person matters a lot, and is something that needs thought and deliberate action. For example "Hi, I'm Casey. Do you have somewhere to live right now?", or "Excuse me, my name is Casey, can I help you out?". It needs to be made clear immediately that your intent is to offer aid, competently. Your goal is to create a connection with the person. There are many strategies that can help with this; an odd example is making sure to ask their name around five or six sentences in, if they haven't already given it. Restating their name at that point if they've already given it is also effective.

#### Reflection & Paraphrasing ####
When we say "active listening", we mean something that's very likely not what you may have learned before. _You can't skip this part_. Reflection and paraphrasing are what we call it when you've fully listened to your client, and synthesize what they have expressed back to them in a manner that makes them know they are being heard. When doing this, it's _vital_ that you avoid parroting what the client has said to you word-for-word. Any AI can accomplish that, and you need to be very human for this to work. We want to process what the person is saying, and reflect the essential meaning of what they are telling you. This is part of the [Empathetic Response](training-direct-stage-one-empathetic-response) system.

_Parroting:_
>Client: “I feel like I've been abandoned by everyone, and I can't even talk to my family.”

>Helper: “I hear you’re feeling abandoned, and can't talk to anyone?"

_Paraphrasing:_

>Client: “I feel like I've been abandoned by everyone, and I can't even talk to my family.”

>Helper: “It makes sense feeling isolated in a situation like this, and being able to express yourself is important.

_The most effective helpers use clarifying questions to make sure they are understanding the client properly. These help let the client know that you care, and you're paying attention, without pushing them. These helperes are also much more likely to catch subtle signs of additional problems the client may have._

#### Validation ####
A person's thoughts, feeling, and personal experience need to be validated. Most people feel very much alone in their situation, and are apt to think nobody cares. To compound this, our society generally doesn't appear to care - that's what you're here to change, right? We want to recognize, normalize, and accept the client. This helps to build rapport, and can make it much easier for the client to open up to you. You can help them to understand that their emotions are a natural response. A client is likely to minimize their own feelings, if they aren't feeling that they are valid. When a person says something that subtly alerts you to how they are feeling - that's the time to validate them.

An example, 
>Client: "I'm stupid for even trying at this point."

>Helper: "From what you've told me, feeling overwhelmed just makes sense. Do you think we can work out some steps to clear this up for you?"

Be mindful of when and how you validate a client. Again, this isn't something an AI can accomplish properly. Let's say that the client feels at fault for something they aren't. A common example, if the client feels comfortable enough to open up to you about a sexual assault and feels guilt associated with it, saying that feeling that way is understandable can actually suggest that you agree. It might be better to tell them something like "People do often feel that way after an assault, but it was not your fault. Nobody deserves that". You can validate the person and their feelings, without normalizing something detrimental. Always bear in mind, these are people. _Handle with care._

Used properly, validation can normalize a client's feelings, allow expression without judgment, show the client that you genuinely care, and give them the permission they may feel they need to accept their own thoughts and feelings. We want to avoid unintended consequences, such as implying that they are at fault, or deserve their situation; implying that their feelings of hopelessness or other negative emotions are justified; or giving permission for destructive behavior. This can be much harder than it sounds, and can take practice to master.

#### Tentafiers ####
It's not likely a word you've heard before, and definitely not something you're suggested to use most of the time! But here, it's a vital skill. Tentafiers are used to preface something like a label, in order to deliberately make it tentative. For example, instead of "You're feeling frustrated." you might say "It seems like you're frustrated". Just that small change alters the impression from one of trying to tell the person how they feel, to one of reaching for understanding.

_Data shows: “You seem,” “So you…”, and “It sounds like…” are the most effective tentafiers. Try listening to what the client says when they're being tentative, and adapt that to be on the same communication page._

#### Open Ended Questions ####
Asking an open-ended question means positing something non-binary. In this way, we let the client expand on whatever thoughts and feelings they need to while searching for an answer more complex than _yes or no_. For you, this allows exploration without having to resort to a professional interview. This needs to be personal. We guide the conversation in an attempt to gather information we need to help the client; but we need them to tell their story to get that.

A closed-ended question can be answered with a simple _yes or no_. They're almost never a good idea, because they box the client into a set of options for what they feel or think. This can prevent you from getting the information you need to go further with helping.

_Data shows: the most successful helpers ask fewer, more open questions. Specifically, “How” questions are associated with effective conversations. “How” falls next, followed by "When," and "What". Because asking "why" has so many negative possible implications, it's strongly discouraged altogether._

#### Strength Identifiers ####
Often, a person needs to be reminded that they have inherent positive qualities. They need to be reminded that they're strong enough to fight their way through their struggle. Giving them a strength identifier accomplishes this in an empowering, non-patronizing manner. It can feel a little weird to do this - especially if you aren't feeling terribly confident yourself - but don't worry. It'll get much more natural with time, and even leak into your normal conversations.

A person in any sort of crisis will tend to place their attention on negatives, which tends to spiral downward. What can you do about that? Remind them of some of the positives, of course! This takes paying close attention and empathizing with the person enough to understand just what their strengths are. A good strength identifier for somebody who has reached out to you for help is to let them know it's brave to reach out. It can be difficult to get through to a person this way, but it's well worth it. For example, if a person is feeling stupid, telling them that they are smart won't help. They aren't going to believe you. However, if you were to say something like "You're trying to get help now, that seems pretty smart to me!" and leave it alone. This can be the time to express a personal feeling yourself, like "I appreciate your bravery.. it's hard to share something like that", or "I'm inspired by how much work you've put into getting this far". 

_Data shows: "brave," "smart," and "proud" are the three most successful strength identifiers._

#### Silence... ####
Sweet, powerful, uncomfortable silence. Sometimes, the best thing you can say is nothing. It might not immediately seem like the best way to build rapport, but we swear the science backs this up. Pausing in a conversation allows the client and helper to both process. It allows an opening for the client to elaborate if they need to. A natural pause can show that you're paying full attention, and not planning your next reply. There's no need to be incredibly awkward, but sometimes waiting a bit before you speak can make all the difference.

#### Vocabulary and Vernacular ####
Word choice is incredibly important to making a client feel heard, and understood. It's tough, but finding the appropriate phrasing helps you to comprehend the unique situation the person is in, and better validates their feelings. Often, the most useful words actually feel the strangest to use! Expanding your "feeling" vocabulary is essential; the more varied your emotional vocabulary, the more specifically you can understand your client. Sometimes, using a high-impact emotional word like "devistated" rather than "sad" can express an understanding of the depth of their feelings.

Try writing a few stories, and with each edition make the feeling words more intense. You'll need to explore and expand on Happy, Sad, Scared, Confused, Nervous, and Anxious among others. Try to find words that fit how you speak in a relatively natural way. Using the stronger terms will feel more natural as you practice. Use your judgement - as with every other part of this system, it can't be done by a computer. Only a human being who actually feels will do.

#### Minimizers and Maximizers ####
Impactful feeling words are useful. The other side of that skill is avoiding minimizers ("a little", "kind of", "sort of") and maximizers ("really", "very", "especially"). The reason is that these words detract from the intensity of a response. That makes sense during normal daily conversation, but this person is going through a different kind of world altogether. You don't want to be making light of a deep feeling they're having, and prevent them from feeling valid. You also don't want to increase intensity by adding a maximizer. A good rule of thumb is that if you have to add an adjective, you haven't hit the right word for what you mean. Identifying feelings accurately is important for formulating an effective solution later on.

#### When To Use What ####
[Reflection and Paraphrasing](#reflection--paraphrasing)
>Shows the client that you're actively listening and trying to put yourself into their shoes. You want to be certain that you understand, without directly asking. Reflecting is a great way to do that.

[Validation](#validation)
>Lets the person see that their feelings are understood, and normal, and natural. It reassures them that there isn't something wrong with them, and that it's okay to feel. Sometimes, a person will try to minimize their own feelings. This is where you need to use good validation skills.

[Tentafiers](#tentafiers)
>Enable you to avoid assumptions about what the client is feeling, or to guide them toward sharing more without asking them another question.

[Empathetic Response](training-direct-stage-one-empathetic-response)
>Shows a client that you're present and paying attention. It shows that you honestly and sincerely care about what they're going through much more effectively than sympathy (ie, "I'm sorry"). If this one doesn't come naturally to you, it's not easy at all to learn. It'll take a lot of work.

[Strength Identifiers](#strength-identifiers)
>Remind the person that they have positive qualities, and have the strength to make it through this hard time and their struggles. It can help to guide a person toward being more open and receptive to help, and feel more empowered to collaborate in problem solving and planning. It only takes a little sentence to make a huge difference.

[Open-Ended Questions](#open-ended-questions)
>Give a wide space for the client to elaborate and explore what they're feeling without turning it into an interview. You can learn a lot just by probing a little.

#### Unintended Consequences ####
We feel it's important that you know you may experience life changes by going through with building these skills. Friends and family may find you easier and more pleasant to share feelings and thoughts with. You also may find yourself feeling more confident socially, and better overall emotionally. This isn't an easy job to take up. It's a worthwhile one.
