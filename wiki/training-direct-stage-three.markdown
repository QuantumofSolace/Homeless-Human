## Identify The Goal ##
Why does this person need help? What do they need help with? 

Why did they text in? What do they need support with? Often in the beginning of a conversation, texters will list multiple issues they are dealing with. All. The. Things. Perhaps they are feeling hopeless because of stress at school, unfriendly coworkers, or an unsupportive family—while battling mental illness. We can’t solve these problems, but we can guide them to identifying what is bothering them most at this moment. Some texters just want someone to listen. Some need to know how to deal with their problem safely.
We identify goals because jumping into problem solving before understanding the texter’s goal will make them feel like you are rushing to wrap things up so you can move on to the next texter. No one likes feeling passed off! Plus, we want to set clear expectations. We’re not going to magically make their anxiety disappear, but we can help them feel more calm in the present moment.
Sometimes, texters will make their goal clear during your exploration together. If you’re unsure of the texter’s goal, you can ask:
“I’m curious, what does help look like for you today?”
“It took strength to share this with me, and I want to make sure I am able to be helpful. What are you looking to gain from this conversation?”
“It makes sense that you’re feeling overwhelmed with so many difficult things at once. It would be helpful for me to know which of these are the most painful for you right now?
It’s worth mentioning that sometimes, texters have specific goals that we can’t meet. It’s important to keep the focus on empowering texters to identify their own solutions. Here’s one way to respond:

Texter: “I just want to know if I should text my ex right now. What do you think?”
or, Texter: “I’m so lost. Just tell me what to do.”
Crisis Counselor: “Feeling lost can be so frustrating. What is it that you want your ex to understand, if you decide to text them?”
Texter Issues. All the issues.
It’s helpful to have background information on a few prevalent issues we see among our texters. Although we are introducing specific populations here, keep in mind that the five stages of a conversation will still be your go-to for every texter you interact with. Imagine that five stages and your active listening skills are your own personal toolbox, stocked with everything you need for success!
